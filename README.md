# Quantum Geometry of Tetrahedra

You can find here a small LaTeX file (.zip) where I tried to describe the scenario of quantum geometry of space, offered by the Loop Quantisation of Gravity (LQG), well discussed in  my master's thesis, as user-friendly as possible.

Thereafter, the quantum geometry of space is modeled by the theory in a discrete lattice made of spin tetrahedra and one is able to describe the quantum geometric properties of space as observables of the theory: they reduce to some self-adjoint operators among finite dimensional vector spaces with real spectra containing the possible outcomes of the measurements, in a perfect quantum flavor.

Everything lies within the framework of multilinear algebra and here you can find Python code computing such matricial geometric observables of the gravitational field.
